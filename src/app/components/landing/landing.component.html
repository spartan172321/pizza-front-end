      A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which
      toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or
      early 19th century.
      <br>
      The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta[3] and successively in different parts of Central and
      Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II
      when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.
